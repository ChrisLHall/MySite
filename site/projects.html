        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>This is a list of interesting projects that I have worked on, in and out of
        school. Each description details the technical challenges of the project
        and the skills I gained from each one.</p>
        <h2><a target="_blank" href="http://citris-uc.org/social-apps-lab/project/griddle/">Griddle - Educational game about the power grid</a></h2>
        <img class="inline_block" src="images/griddle_thumbnail.png" />
        <p><strong>Skills:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a>,
          C#, Agile development</p>
        <p><strong>Collaborators:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://erg.berkeley.edu/people/michael-cohen/">Michael
          Cohen</a> leads the project, I was one of many students working on it</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Griddle is an in-development educational game by
        <a target="_blank" href="http://erg.berkeley.edu/people/michael-cohen/">Michael Cohen</a>
        which will be used to
        educate high-school and college students about how the power grid works,
        and about the challenges and benefits of renewable vs. conventional
        energy. It covers concepts from system design to generation scheduling,
        all the way down to responding to day-to-day challenges and crises. I
        worked on this project for about 8 hours a week for 3 semesters, and
        part-time during the summer of 2014. The game has been used to teach
        several lessons at Berkeley High School.</p>
        <p>Most of the code I worked on was either on the power grid
        simulation engine or on the user interface and controls. I now have
        significant experience with the Unity editor, and in particular the
        new GUI layout system they introduced in 2014. The team used a mostly
        Agile development process of two-week sprints and a weekly meeting to
        check progress and/or plan the next sprint. I was one of at least three
        programmers on the project at any given time, so I learned a lot about
        writing maintainable/readable code, giving and receiving feedback, and
        being communicative about my progress.</p>

        <h2><a target="_blank" href="http://challengepost.com/software/pulley">Pulley - Deployment system for websites on Git</a></h2>
        <a target="_blank" href="http://challengepost.com/software/pulley"><img class="inline_block" src="images/pulley_thumbnail.jpg" /></a>
        <p><strong>Skills:</strong> HTML5/CSS/JQuery, Bootstrap, PHP</p>
        <p><strong>Collaborators:</strong> <a target="_blank" href= "http://iangoegebuer.com/">Ian Goegebuer</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/johnnypatterson">Johnny Patterson</a>,
        <a target="_blank" href="http://web.csulb.edu/~jang2/">Jasmine Ang</a></p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Pulley is a website admin tool intended
        for use with sites that are written using Git source control. It allows
        a site owner to deploy websites from a Git repositiories onto a live
        server by clicking one button. The dashboard page shows the name and URL
        of each of the sites, and indicates whether the version running on the
        server is up-to-date with the code in the repositories. The system also
        allows you to snapshot a MySQL database running on the server and save
        it to a Git repository for backup. This project won two awards at
        <a target="_blank" href="http://hackuci.challengepost.com/">HackUCI 2014</a>.
        It is too rough around the edges to have an open-source distribution at
        the moment.</p>
        <p>This project started with a very concise idea and the team didn't
        add many new features during development, so that by the end of the
        hackathon we had a very polished and useable product. I'm proud of what
        we made, and I learned a lot of PHP and frontend web programming along
        the way.</p>

        <h2>3-Stage RISC-V CPU on Xilinx FPGA (school project)</h2>
        <img class="inline_block" src="images/cpu_thumbnail.jpg" />
        <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Verilog, Xilinx toolchain</p>
        <p><strong>Collaborator:</strong> <a target="_blank" href= "https://github.com/challiwill">Corbin Halliwill</a></p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> In the UC Berkeley class called "Components
        and Design Techniques for Digital Systems" (Computer Science 150) students
        designed a CPU with a 3-stage pipeline and implemented it in Verilog on
        a Xilinx FPGA. The biggest challenge of the project was debugging small
        logic errors and timing problems, and as a
        result I gained a lot of experience with the Xilinx simulation and
        analysis tools and the ChipScope FPGA debugging tool. The thumbnail shows
        what happens when you mess up your UART transmitter block!</p>

        <h2>Python Compiler (school project)</h2>
        <img class="inline_block" src="images/compiler_thumbnail.png" />
        <p><strong>Skills:</strong> C++, regular expressions</p>
        <p><strong>Collaborators:</strong> Jeffrey Seyfried, Shaun Singh, Aaron Zhou</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> The "Programming Languages and Compilers"
        class at UC Berkeley (Computer Science 164) teaches students to build a compiler for a reduced
        and static-typed dialect of Python. In the first of three projects,
        students create a lexer and parser to build abstract syntax trees from
        Python source. The second project is a type inferrer, which decorates
        the syntax trees with type information and then infers the static types
        of expressions that are not specified. The third project is a code
        generator, in which the final type-inferred syntax tree is converted
        into C++ source and compiled with GCC to create an executable.</p>

        <h2>Raytracer (school project)</h2>
        <img class="inline_block" src="images/raytracer_thumbnail.png" />
        <p><strong>Skills:</strong> C++</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> The introductory computer graphics
        course at UC Berkeley (Computer Science 184) has a few projects which
        explore different aspects of rendered 3D graphics. One of the projects
        is a raytracer, which produced the image on the left. A raytracer
        simulates reflections and shadows by casting rays from a camera into a
        3D scene and calculating the color of each pixel based on what objects
        the rays hit, whether they are illuminated by a light source, whether
        they have a reflection of another object, etc. All of these qualities
        are calculated by casting rays in the scene and testing intersections
        with the polygons in the scene. My implementation featured reflections,
        shadows, anti-aliasing of pixels through multi-sampling, and area lights
        / soft shadows through Monte Carlo sampling. In other words a lot a lot
        a lot of vector and matrix operations.
