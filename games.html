        <p>Here are games I made or worked on over the past couple years,
        ordered by how good I think they are. Most of them are playable in a web
        browser. Also, check out my <a target="_blank" href="http://gamejolt.com/profile/turnipturnip/271750/">GameJolt profile</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Platform:</strong> Browser/HTML5 using <a target="_blank" href="http://melonjs.org/">MelonJS</a></p>
        <p><strong>Released:</strong> February 2014</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Dig your way through blocks of ice
        searching for your friend the cat. Collect bones for extra time, gold
        for points, or powerups for faster searching. The game was implemented
        in JavaScript using <a target="_blank" href="http://melonjs.org/">MelonJS</a>, an
        open-source HTML5 game library.</p>

        <p><strong>Platform:</strong> Browser/HTML5 using <a target="_blank" href="http://melonjs.org/">MelonJS</a></p>
        <p><strong>Released:</strong> April 2014</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Piggies was born as an April Fool's
        joke in 2014, heavily inspired by my friend posting the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZvnfBTnaj0">Goat Simulator trailer soundtrack</a> on Facebook that morning. I would have to write original
        music to put it on GameJolt, but it sounds pretty amazing with the Goat
        Simulator soundtrack so I won't do that anytime soon. As a disclaimer,
        this game is really odd and doesn't make sense. Don't say I didn't warn
        you!</p>

        <p><strong>Platform:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a></p>
        <p><strong>Released:</strong> March 2015</p>
        <p><strong>Collaborator:</strong> Stephanie Lin</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Tommy Tubbies is a point-and-click adventure about a young
        and emotionally volatile boy who finds himself in a nightmare about the kids'
        TV show his baby sister watches. Some of the control is clunky and there
        is no audio, but this game offers a complete narrative with two endings.
        Created for the Game Design Methods class at UC Berkeley.

        <p><strong>Platform:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yoyogames.com/studio">Game Maker</a></p>
        <p><strong>Released:</strong> December 2013</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Giles was intended to be an entry to
        <a target="_blank" href="http://ludumdare.com/compo">Ludum Dare 28</a>,
        with the theme "you only get one." I finished too late to enter the
        competition, but I was able to write an original soundtrack and the game
        turned out great. Giles is a Snake
        clone but with a puzzle-oriented twist: in each level, you must eat the
        mouse, which is Giles' favorite food. Once you do though Giles will grow
        uncontrollably, so make sure you can find a way back home! Finishing
        each level earns a silver medal. Eating all the frogs and rabbits in a
        level merits a gold medal.

        <p><strong>Platform:</strong> Browser/HTML5</p>
        <p><strong>Released:</strong> June 2014</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> CoffeeBox is an experimental pseudo-
        3d game developed for <a target="_blank" href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/lowrezjam2014">LowRezJam 2014</a>,
        a competition which challenged developers to create a game with 32x32
        pixel resolution. CoffeeBox is a 3d platformer with a top-down view.
        Each pixel represents a block in the 3d world which the player can stand
        on and jump from. Blocks further below the player are represented as
        darker pixels in-game. The player must explore the small world and
        collect all of the glowing coffee beans. Overall the game is rather
        difficult to play because of the small resolution and awkward
        representation of 3d-space, but conceptually it is interesting and in a
        few places in the game it looks very nice. A list of JS libraries I
        used to implement the game can be found on its
        <a target="_blank" href="http://gamejolt.com/games/platformer/coffee-box/27476/">GameJolt page.</a></p>

        <a target="_blank" href="http://chrislhall.net/LifeInsurance/"><img class="inline_block" src="images/lifeinsurance_thumbnail.png" /></a>
        <p><strong>Platform:</strong> Browser/HTML5</p>
        <p><strong>Released:</strong> April 2015</p>
        <p><strong>Collaborator:</strong> William Wu</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Cash Out was developed as a final
        project for a personal finance class I took at UC Berkeley. It is
        unpredictable and thus not very fun, but inside it contains a semi-
        interesting model of how people decide how much life insurance coverage
        to have based on their income, age, and number of dependents. The game
        is written entirely in HTML5/CSS/JS using a bit of JQuery.</p>
